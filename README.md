👋 Hello there! I'm Mowlood, a Biomedical Engineering graduate with a deep passion for coding and technology.👩🏻‍💻✨

🧬 As a biomedical engineer, I've explored the intersection of biology and technology, working on projects that bridge the gap between healthcare and innovation. My academic background has equipped me with a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving skills.

💻 Coding, however, is where my heart truly lies. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging my engineering knowledge to create software solutions that make a positive impact. From data analysis to building applications, I enjoy the process of bringing ideas to life through code.

🚀 Currently exploring the vast world of software development, and studing DevOps engineering at AiCore, I enjoy coding with Python and I believe in the power of technology to transform and improve lives.

🔍 Always eager to learn and collaborate, I'm here to connect with like-minded individuals, contribute to interesting projects, and grow as a developer. Let's code for a brighter and healthier future! 🌟

📫 Feel free to reach out for discussions, collaborations, or just a friendly chat. Let's create something amazing together!
